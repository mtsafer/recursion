<h1>Recursion</h1>
<p>Recursion is considered both a fundamental precept of computer science and a litmus test that separates the decent programmers from the terrible ones.</p>
<p>Here I complete a couple of problems using recursion.</p>
<p>The problems are given by <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and can be found <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion">here</a>.</p>
